Get ready for summer! This year-round custom built robust caravan will see you through all the seasons. The bright yet warm interior design is closer to a tiny house on wheels but without losing a single bit of mobility. This was built to travel and for permanent living - suitable for both. The unique design is both lightweight but spacious. The top lifts up to its full height with solid, well insulated walls.

This caravan has definitely been experience tested. We (two small sized humans) have lived in it for more than one full year. It has held up well in wind and in rain, from 5 to 35 degrees. One of us works by computer full time, relying solely on the solar system. We are selling because we want to build the next project.
